        Dark chocolate, with its notable deep brown color, is the second most popular type of chocolate.
        It is sometimes referred to as black or semisweet chocolate and is noticeably less sweet than other chocolates.
        The flavor profile of dark chocolate can vary widely based on the cocoa content of the chocolate. It is often
        slightly-sweet and chocolatey, with notes of baked brownie, red fruit, and brown spice (think cinnamon or
        allspice).<br><br>

        Dark chocolate is fairly simple in composition. It is typically made from two ingredients â€” chocolate liquor and
        sugar. Sometimes small amounts of vanilla and soy lecithin (an emulsifier) are added. Dark chocolate must
        contain at least 15% chocolate liquor but usually contains closer to about 50%. Most high-quality,
        dark chocolate <u><b>does not contain added dairy </u></b> and can be a great <b>vegan-friendly</b> chocolate.
        Because of lack of dairy and less sugar dark chocolate has firmer texture than milk chocolate or white
        chocolate. And thats why a well-tempered piece of dark chocolate will have a nice snap when broken in
        half.<br><br>

        Dark chocolate is a rich source of antioxidants and minerals, and it generally contains less sugar than milk or
        white chocolate. Some research suggests that dark chocolate have many help lower the risk of heart disease,
        reduce inflammation and improve brain function.
