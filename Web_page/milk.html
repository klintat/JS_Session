    <p class="paragraph">Milk chocolate is a classic that we all know and love from childhood. With its light brown
        color, creamy texture, and sweet flavor, milk chocolate is widely regarded as the most popular type of
        chocolate. It is made by combining chocolate liquor (cocoa solids and cocoa butter) with sugar, and milk.
        Milk chocolate must contain at least 10% chocolate liquor and 12% milk.<br><br>

        Break off a piece of milk chocolate and let the aroma fill the air. Milk chocolate often has a
        flavor profile that can be described as sweet and chocolatey, with notes of cooked milk and caramelized sugar
        and a vanilla aftertaste.<br><br>

        Milk chocolate is considered to be a good middle of the road chocolate. It is characteristically sweeter, with a
        softer texture than dark chocolate, but not quite as sweet and soft as white chocolate. Milk chocolate is a
        great choice for when you want a chocolate treat or gift everyone will enjoy.
