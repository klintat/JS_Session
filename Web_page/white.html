        White chocolate is easy to identify because of its cream or ivory color. It is made by combining sugar, cocoa
        butter, milk, vanilla, and lecithin (an emulsifier that helps the ingredients blend together). These ingredients
        give white chocolate its sweet vanilla aroma. White chocolate often has a flavor profile that can be described
        as predominately sweet, with bold notes of sweetened condensed milk and vanilla. Good quality white chocolate
        will have a rich, soft, and creamy texture — a characteristic that comes from its cocoa butter base and high
        sugar and milk content.<br><br>

        White chocolate is unique because it does not contain any cocoa solids. The cocoa solids are what give chocolate
        it's dark brown color and chocolatey taste that we all know and love. It is inportant to say that in order for
        something to be considered white chocolate it must contain at least 20% cocoa butter and 14% milk, and no more
        than 55% sugar.<br><br>

        Many ask, “Is white chocolate, chocolate?” The answer is <b>yes</b> because it contains ingredients from the
        cacao bean. Not to be confused with the white-flavored or vanilla-flavored coating that is often found in
        sub-par
        products. If white chocolate meet the 20% cocoa butter requirement it can be officially called white chocolate.
